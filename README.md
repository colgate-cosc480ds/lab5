# Lab 5

Welcome to the *fifth* COSC 480 Data Science Lab!  You are encouraged to work with a partner for this lab.

This lab is due **Monday, March 27 2017 at 11:59pm**.  Submission instructions are similar to previous labs.  *When you finish, please be sure to write a commit message!*  


## Setup

For this lab, please clone the source code from the textbook *Data Science from Scratch*.  

	vagrant@ubuntu:~$ cd /vagrant
	vagrant@ubuntu:/vagrant$ git clone https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch.git


## Your Tasks

Follow the two python notebooks, Lab5GradientDescent and Lab5LinearRegression.  In each notebook, there are tasks for you to complete.  Each one is labeled with "todo".  Make sure you complete all of the todo's in both notebooks.

You may write any additional code in `lab5.py` or directly in the notebooks.  I suggest that bigger chunks of code are written in `lab5.py` and the notebook is primarily used for short snippets and calling functions imported from `lab5`.
